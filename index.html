    <h1>Welcome to Access Code 3.X - 2016 JavaScript Workshop</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Access Code 2015 bootcamp! In this workshop we'll be teaching you the basics of JavaScript and some of the fundamentals of programming. During this class you'll learn about expressions, variables, Arrays, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions, and use these concepts to write your own programs!
    </p>
    </p>
      This workshop also serves as part of the Access Code application process. After this workshop, you'll be given an assessment containing questions about reading and writing JavaScript. The assessment will test your understanding of what you will learn during the workshop, as well as your ability and initiative to teach yourself new concepts in a short period of time. We'll look at the assessment as part of your application.
