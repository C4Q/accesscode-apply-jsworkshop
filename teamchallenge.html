    <h1>Team Challenge</h1>

    <p>We've gone over a lot of material in just a couple days.  We've leaned about arrays, conditionals, variables, arrays, functions and loops.  This final exercise gives us a chance to combine all those elements into a single project. </p>

    <p>This exercise is challenging and in order to complete it, you will need to go beyond what we have taught you. In Pursuit, we emphasize continuous learning and how to seek out and learn new information to solve problems.</p>

    <p>This exercise is also meant to challenge your ability to work as a team. We are less interested in seeing a perfect solution, and more interested in your group successfully working together.</p>

    <p>What we want to see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have utilized the resources given to you during this workshop</li>
      <li>You have researched and attempted to learn additional concepts</li>
      <li>You have given careful thought to how to best solve the problem</li>
      <li>Clear communication among team members</li>
      <li>All team members contribute to a common solution</li>
      <li>The team maintains a positive culture</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Task</h2>

    <p>Your team will be responsible for creating a version of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>

    <p>Core gameplay:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A prompt appears on the screen asking the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors</li>
      <li>When the user clicks "OK", their throw is logged to the console</li>
      <li>The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then the computer's throw is logged to the console</li>
      <li>Your program looks at the two throws, and logs a message to the console that says if the player won, lost or if the game was a tie</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Advanced Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have a prompt come up that lets the player play the game again</li>
      <li>If both the user and the computer pick the same thing, have the user/computer keep entering new throws until there is a winner or loser</li>
      <li>Make a game a best of 3 instead of a single throw</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Important resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In order to get prompts to work, you will need to use a repl at <a href = "https://repl.it/languages/html" target="_blank">this link here</a></li>
      <li>Click on "script.js" on the left to start writing javascript, and click on "console" on the right to see the console</li>
      <li>Use <b>prompt("Your prompt here")</b> to make an alert with a text field appear on the screen.  More information can be found at the <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt" target = "_blank">documentation here</a></li>
      <p>Here is an example of a CLI game: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14IXuxOBU-Fhe5XyNyd8amkDHkMoqJc0m/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Rock Paper Scissors</a>. Everything you see is taking place in the console. In this example the input “node rps.js” is the equivalent of hitting “run”.</p>
