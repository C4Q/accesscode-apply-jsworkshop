    <h2>What is a Variable?</h2>
    
    <p>
      A good analogy is a <b>labeled box</b>. Outside is the label, inside is something, and it could be anything!

    <p>
      Officially:
      A variable is a <b>container</b>. It has both a <b>name</b> and a <b>value</b>. You
      declare a new variable with the <code>var</code> keyword, and <b>assign</b> it 
      (aka give it) a value with the <code>=</code> sign.
    </p>
    <pre><code>var variableOne = 1
var variableTwo = "Two"
var bensFavLanguage = "JavaScript"
console.log("Ben's favorite language is: " + bensFavLanguage)</code></pre>

    <p>
      In JavaScript the <b>value</b> of a variable can change, but the name cannot.
      However, you can assign variables with values from other variables.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>var bensFavLanguage = "JavaScript"
var studentsFavLanguage = "French"
console.log("Student's favorite language was " + studentsFavLanguage)
// It was French!

// .... after this lecture ....
studentsFavLanguage = bensFavLanguage
console.log("Student's favorite language was " + studentsFavLanguage)
// Now it's JavaScript!</code></pre>
   
   <p>
     Other fun facts and features of variables:
     <ul>
       <li>Variables can be used and reused as many times as you want</li>
       <li>Variables can hold different kinds or <b>types</b> of data (Integers, Strings, and more!)</li>
       <li>The name of a variable is very important for you and others reading your code.</li>
       <li>The name of a variable can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes. However it cannot START with a number or a dash (but it can start with an underscore).
     </ul>
