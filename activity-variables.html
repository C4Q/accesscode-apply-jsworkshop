    <h1>Activity: Variables</h1>
    
    <p>
      Let's create:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A variable called `helloWrold`</li>
      <li>A variable called `hiMyNameIs`</li>
      <li>A variable called `this_is_snake_cased`</li>
      <li>A variable called `thisVarHasNumbers111`</li>
      <li>A variable called `this-var-has-dashes`</li>
      <li>A variable containing letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores</li>
      <li>Let's try to break JavaScript: make some variables that error out!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use <code>console.log(myVariable)</code> to print out each variable to the console. You can also prepend it with a string and use the <code>+</code> operator to squish them together (the fancy name for that is to <b>concatenate</b> or <b>join</b> them together).
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>console.log("The value of [something] is " + someVariable)</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b> If the value of the variable is NOT a String and you try and concatenate it with a string, JavaScript will do a nice thing and convert it to a String for you. <i>However this can be dangerous</i>, JavaScript is not very smart and might convert it incorrectly. This might not be an issue for simple examples, but consider yourself warned!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now create a variable containing for each of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>Your age</li>
      <li>Your favorite food</li>
      <li>Your favorite film, book, or tv show (or one for each!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Math (Expressions)</h2>
    
    <p>
      You can do math on variables too as long as they are numbers! Let's find out your birth year by subtracting your age (let's use the variable you defined in the last step) from the current year:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>var currentYear = 2016
var myBirthYear = currentYear - myAge
console.log("My birth year is " + myBirthYear)</code></pre>
    
    
    <p>
      It can get quite a bit more complicated:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>var companyRevenue = 1000000
var officeRent = 250000
var employeeSalary = 75000
var numberOfEmployees = 4
var taxRate = 0.4
var profit = (companyRevenue - officeRent - employeeSalary * numberOfEmployees) * taxRate
console.log("Profit this year was " + profit)</code></pre>
   
    <p>
      Try changing the values like the rent, or the number of employees, and see how profit changes. This is why programming is so powerful!
    </p>

    <h2>Useful and important syntax</h2>    
    <pre><code>var someNumber = 0

//Increment: take a value and increase it by 1
someNumber = someNumber + 1
someNumber += 1 // This and the above line can be any number
someNumber++
++someNumber

//Decrement: take a value and decrease it by 1
someNumber = someNumber - 1
someNumber -= 1 // This and the above line can be any number
someNumber--
--someNumber

//Multiply: take a value and multiply it by x
someNumber = someNumber * x
someNumber *= x

//Divide: take a value and divide it by x
someNumber = someNumber / x
someNumber /= x
</code></pre>
    <p>
      The word we use to describe turning a set of code into a single value is called <b>evaluate</b> or <b>execute</b>. This is useful to think about in situations where we assign the result of some math to a variable:
    </p>
    <pre><code>var x = 10
var y = 20
var someVariable = (100 * x / y) - x*y
x = 0
y = 0
console.log(someVariable)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The value of some variable is decided at the moment of assignment when that line of code gets <b>executed</b> and the <b>expression</b> on the right side of the assignment gets <b>evaluated</b>.
