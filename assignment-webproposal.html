    <h1>Assignment: Web Application Proposal</h1>

    <p>
      As part of your Access Code application, you will create and present a proposal for a web app you would
      like to build.  Think about a web application or web site you wish existed, but doesn't.  As an Access
      Code graduate, you'll be able to build it yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Your proposal should include at least the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Your name.</p></li>
      <li><p>The name of your web app.</p></li>
      <li><p>One or more <em>user stories</em>.  A user story is a description of <em>who</em> a user of the app
        might be, <em>why</em> s/he is using the app, and <em>how</em> s/he interacts with it to meet his/her
        goals.</p></li>
      <li><p>A description of the app's pages and their visual layout, and/or <em>mockups</em> of the pages.
        A mockup is a rough sketch of what the page looks like.</p></li>
      <li><p>A list of the features of the app, and/or descriptions of all the ways a user can interact with
        it.  Remember that a web app is not just a static web page with fixed text and pictures; a web
        app responds to user inputs and actions with sophisticated behaviors.</p></li>
      <li><p>A list of technical challenges that must be overcome to build the web app.  Keep in mind that
        no developer can predict technical challenges perfectly in advance, so use your best judgement
        to guess what will be hard to do.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please include <em>any additional information</em> you feel improves the proposal as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to use any tools you are comfortable with to write your proposal and prepare supporting
      materials.  The web provides many free tools you can use.  For example,
      <ul>
        <li>Google Docs is a great way to prepare a document with text and pictures.</li>
        <li>Many drawing, sketching, and image editing apps can be helpful in making sketches.</li>
        <li>Google Image Search can help you find images to incorporate in your designs.</li>
        <li>There are several free tools available especially for creating mockups of web and mobile apps.</li>
        <li>Pencil and paper is still a great way to sketch!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <p>
      You will present your proposal to a group of your peers during Day 2 of this workshop.  You'll go over
      your written proposal, and discuss the user story, design, and interactivity of the app.
      Your peers will ask questions about the proposal, as well as give constructive suggestions for improving
      the proposal, which you'll discuss as a group.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll also have the opportunity to listen to your peers' proposals, ask questions about them, and
      provide feedback with your own ideas of how to improve their proposals.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      Proposals will be evaluated based on the following.
      <ul>
        <li>How thoroughly did you think through your web app's user stories, design, and features?</li>
        <li>Did you prepare a careful written proposal?</li>
        <li>How creative is your design?</li>
        <li>Did you search for, find, and use online resources and tools to improve your proposal?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Presentations will be evaluated based on the following.
      <ul>
        <li>Is your presentation well-prepared, clear, and thorough?</li>
        <li>Do you ask good questions about your peers' proposals?</li>
        <li>Do listen carefully to questions and do your best to discuss them?</li>
        <li>Do you provide constructive suggestions about your peers' proposals?</li>
        <li>Do you accept and discuss your peers' suggestions for your proposal?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Bring <b>eight printed copies</b> of your proposal to Day Two of this workshop.
          If you don't have access to a printer, please make sure your proposal is availabel on line,
          and arrive a few minutes early to print your proposal at C4Q.</p></li>
        <li><p>Plan and rehease your presentation. You will have about 5 minutes to present.</p></li>
        <li><p>Prepare to analyze, evaluate, and provide suggestions for your peers' presentations.</p></li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      We've created an example proposal <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dij2ga1rBlCrMLrGu7Lv5u0Ih35SchG74rBUoto30vo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
      Don't treat this as a template, but rather as inspiration; feel free improve on the
      format and content however you think is best.
