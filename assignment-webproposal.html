    <h1>Assignment: Web Application Concept Statement</h1>

    <p>
      As part of this workshop, you will create a concept for a web app you would
      like to build.  A web app is a computer program that runs within a web browser such as Chrome,
      and uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to respond to users.  In developing this concept, you will
      try your hand at product design, which is a part of the Access Code program.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Concept Statement (individual)</h2>
    <p>
      The Concept Statement is assigned during Day 1 of the workshop and due at the beginning of
      Day 2.
    </p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Think of a problem that is personally important to you.  It may be
      a problem you've experienced yourself, or that affects a community you're part of, or that relates
      to a hobby, interest, cause, or passion important to you.  Then think about how a web
      app could address the problem.  The problem does not need to be deeply profound (you don't have to
      cure cancer!), but choose one that you are passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've chosen a problem, research existing solutions to the problem, particularly web sites,
      web apps, and mobile apps that might already address it.  Think about what works well about these,
      and what doesn't work as well.  Then think about how <em>you</em> would like to solve the
      problem using a web app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Concept Statement should include at least these sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The name of your Concept Statement, and your name.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <em>Problem Statement</em>, providing context and explaining in detail what the problem is.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A summary of <em>Existing Solutions</em> to the problem, which may be technological or
          otherwise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One or more <em>User Stories</em>.  A user story is a description of <em>who</em> a user of the app
          might be, <em>why</em> s/he is using the app, and <em>how</em> s/he interacts with it to meet his/her
          goals. The user could be someone you know, or an imaginary typical user.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <em>Concept</em> for the web app, explaining its major features and how they work together
          to address the problem better than the existing solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Feel free to add additional sections to your Concept Statements to represent additional insights
      and ideas you might have.
    </p>
    <p>

      sample Concept Statement is here.</a>  Your Concept Statement does not need to look exactly like the sample, but
      make sure you include the sections above.
    </p>

    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Upload a PDF of your Concept Statement to the your unique link emailed to you via Greenhouse.</b>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      Your Concept Statement and Proposal will be evaluated on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How thoroughly did you think through your the problem, user stories, design, and features?</li>
      <li>How thoroughly did you research existing solutions?</li>
      <li>Did you prepare a carefully-written writeup?</li>
      <li>How creative is your solution to the problem?</li>
    </ul>
